# Autodesk Dynamo MCP Integration Project

This is a core integration project that connects **Autodesk Dynamo** to AI systems (such as Claude Desktop) through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
With this system, AI can directly control Dynamo for BIM automation operations, enabling "zero-intervention" automated modeling and querying.

---

## 🚀 Latest Version v3.4: Enhanced Analysis & Visualization
The project has been upgraded to **v3.4**, introducing powerful script analysis tools and node management features:

1.  **Visualization Analysis (`/image`)**: Automatically analyze Dynamo scripts and generate Mermaid flowcharts and analysis reports, supporting large complex graphs (100+ nodes).
2.  **Node Grouping (`create_group`)**: Support for organizing selected nodes into groups to improve graph readability and management efficiency.
3.  **Stability Optimization**: Fixed WebSocket timeout issues when analyzing large graphs and enhanced the reliability of the auto-startup mechanism.
4.  **Repository Structure Optimization**: Reorganized the root directory, classifying logs, testing tools, and experimental scripts into dedicated folders to ensure a clean development environment.

## 🤖 AI Agent Usage Guide

This project provides an AI automation interface through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, supporting multiple AI agents.

### Supported AI Agents

- ✅ **Antigravity** (Google Deepmind)
- ✅ **Claude Desktop** (Anthropic)
- ✅ **Gemini CLI** (Google)
- ✅ Any MCP-compatible AI Agent

```json
"dynamo-mcp": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["absolute/path/to/bridge/node/index.js"]
}
```

**Claude Desktop**:

- 📋 [Node Connection Workflow](domain/node_connection_workflow_EN.md)

**How to Use**:
```
# Tell AI to reference documentation
"Please refer to docs/ai-guide/quick-start.md to create Dynamo nodes"
```

#### 3. Available MCP Tools

- `execute_dynamo_instructions` - Create nodes and connections
- `analyze_workspace` - Analyze workspace state
- `search_nodes` - Search available nodes (formerly `list_available_nodes`)

### Antigravity-Specific Features (Optional)

Antigravity users can install the Skill for automatic triggering:

**Symbolic Link Method** (recommended for developers):
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink `
  -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\antigravity\skills\dynamo-automation" `
  -Target "C:\Path\To\AutodeskDynamo_MCP\.skills\dynamo-automation"
```

**Manual Copy Method**:
```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse ".skills\dynamo-automation" `

### Revit to Dynamo Version Mapping

> The table below reflects current deployment and validation in this project. Always verify the actual Dynamo version installed on each machine before testing.

| Revit Version | Dynamo Revit Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 2020 | 2.3.0.5885 | Verified (core smoke) |
| 2021 | 2.6.1.8786 | Verified (core smoke) |
| 2022 | 2.10.1.3976 | Verified (core smoke) |
| 2023 | 2.13.1.3887 | Verified (core smoke) |
| 2024 | 2.19.3.6394 | Verified (core/advanced/python smoke) |
| 2025 | 3.0.3.7597 | Verified (core smoke) |
| 2026 | 3.4.1.7055 | Verified (core smoke) |
| 2027 | 4.0.2.3852 | Verified (core smoke) |

### 2020-2027 Test Summary

| Revit Version | Core Smoke (analyze -> clear -> execute -> analyze) | Advanced Smoke | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2020 | Passed | Not executed | Connection and Code Block creation are stable |
| 2021 | Passed | Not executed | Connection and Code Block creation are stable |
| 2022 | Passed | Not executed | Connection and Code Block creation are stable |
| 2023 | Passed | Not executed | Connection and Code Block creation are stable |
| 2024 | Passed | Passed | 2-point/1-line and Python Script pipeline verified |
| 2025 | Passed | Not executed | Connection and Code Block creation are stable |
| 2026 | Passed | Not executed | Connection and Code Block creation are stable |
| 2027 | Passed | Not executed | Restored after fixing 27.0 deployment path mapping |

### Multi-version Installation Strategy

To avoid assuming every user has Revit 2020-2027 installed, use two modes:

1. Full matrix mode (maintainers/regression): validate all versions 2020-2027.
2. Detected-install mode (most users): deploy only versions detected on the local machine.

Common commands:

```powershell
# Detected-install mode: deploy.ps1 auto-selects locally installed versions
./deploy.ps1

# Single target version (example: 2027)
./deploy.ps1 -TargetDynamoVersions 4.0
```

For a reusable low-token installation flow, see:

- [`docs/revit-2020-2027-install-test-plan.md`](docs/revit-2020-2027-install-test-plan.md), sections "4.5 One-page Quick Install Guide" and "4.6 Low-Token Interaction Template".

### Cautions

1. Revit 2027 actually uses `%AppData%\\Dynamo\\Dynamo Revit\\27.0`, not `4.0`.
2. Dynamo 4.x build requires .NET 10 SDK; without it, 2027 deployment cannot build updated DLLs.
3. Always close Revit/Dynamo before redeploying to avoid DLL file lock issues.
4. Opening Dynamo UI does not guarantee MCP is connected; verify with `active_sessions > 0` in `get_server_stats`.
5. If package files are updated but UI does not reflect changes, close and reopen the Dynamo window once.

Quick local check:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\Autodesk" -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "Revit *" }
Get-ChildItem "$env:AppData\Dynamo\Dynamo Revit" -Directory
```

## 🔥 Core Operational Tools (AI Tools)

| Tool Name | Functionality | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `execute_dynamo_instructions` | Place nodes and connectors on the canvas | Core automated modeling |
| `clear_workspace` | **[NEW]** One-click workspace clearing | Redesign or redrawing |
| `analyze_workspace` | Query current node status and errors | Debugging and status checking |
| `search_nodes` | Search available Dynamo nodes (including .dyf) | Find modeling tools |
| `get_script_library` | Get list of available scripts | Modular reuse |

> [!TIP]
> **Prevent Overlapping Features**: When executing `execute_dynamo_instructions`, you can set `clear_before_execute=True` to automatically clear the canvas before drawing new geometry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Ensure Stable Connection**: Please ensure the `BIM Assistant` -> `Connect to MCP Server` is checked in the Dynamo Top Menu. By default, "Auto-Connect on Startup" is enabled to ensure the extension operates in the correct context automatically.

## 🏥 System Health Check

The new version supports health check endpoints for real-time system status queries and problem diagnosis:

**Usage Example**:
```python
import urllib.request, json

req = urllib.request.Request(
    "ws://127.0.0.1:65296",
    data=json.dumps({"action": "health_check"}).encode(),
    headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
)
response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
health = json.loads(response.read().decode())
print(f"Status: {health['status']}, Uptime: {health['uptimeSeconds']} seconds")
```

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "2.3",
  "sessionId": "abc-123...",
  "processId": 12345,
  "uptimeSeconds": 3600,
  "workspace": {"name": "Home", "nodeCount": 15}
}
```

## 📖 Usage and Control (Clients)

### 1. Antigravity / Gemini CLI
Add the following to Antigravity's MCP configuration:
```json
"dynamo-mcp": {
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["absolute/path/to/server.py"]
}
```

### 2. Claude Desktop (Recommended)
Click the "Edit Config" button in Claude Desktop settings and add the following:

```json
"dynamo-mcp": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "absolute\\path\\to\\bridge\\node\\index.js"
  ]
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Connection Order**: Before starting the AI Client, it is recommended to manually start `python bridge/python/server.py` to ensure the WS port is available.
> After configuration, `dynamo-mcp` (green light) will appear in the Claude list, and you can start using it.
